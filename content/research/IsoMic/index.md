## Detect, Locate, Isolate, and Classify Overlapping Sounds!

{{< dvs_justify_align_text text="This is another \"oh it would be so cool if we can see this in real time, let me try\" task. It turned out there are a bunch of challenges, not research related, but crucial for a live demo. This live acoustic heatmap with a 49-element spiral mic array can even show the sound reflecting off the ceiling and the desk! Hopefully can see this work at somewhere soon ...">}}
